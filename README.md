# TimeMessage
sends a Windows message at a time that suits your needs

This program really just sends a message after a certain number of seconds, idk why this is necessary maybe you want to display a Fuck you message on your screen every hour or something else

so far only in Russian, as I am from Russia, in the future if I learn, I will add English.
